#All notes regarding Big data
Big data:Big data is a collection of data sets with high volume that is very defficult to process using on hand data base tool or traditional data base processing applications
Characteristics of big data:when do we say we are dealing with big data? for someone 1 TB ius very Big,for others 100GB is very big,for others something is big.Hence we identified big data by few characteristics which are specific to big data.Those are                            volume -->It refers the size of data                                                                                                      velocity-->It refers the speed at which data being generated                                                                              varity   -->It rwfwers the type of data                                                                                                    variability                                                                                                                                veracity                                                                                                                                  validity                                                                                                                                  vulnerability                                                                                                                              volatility                                                                                                                                visualization                                                                                                                              value
